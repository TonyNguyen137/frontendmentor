## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla css (scss) and JS
- Bundler tool Parceljs
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

the focus was mainly on clean structured scss code without repitions. I followed and customised the [7 - 1 sass pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/) by [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/)

### Continued development

I am still trying to develope and improve my workflow. Trying out tools such as [Parceljs](https://parceljs.org/), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) etc. to optimize my final code for deployment.
