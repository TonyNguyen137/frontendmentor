# All Challenges are from

[frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

# Server

for my projects I use either [parceljs](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) or [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

# How to start local server

Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. If you never worked with nodejs before then go watch some youtube tutorials.

1. download the depedencies with:

```
  npm -i
```

2. start server (the code depends on the tool I use, just check the 'scripts' in package.json of each project):

```
  npm run start or npm run dev
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; something like this should appear in the terminal, click on the http\* link:

```
Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨ Built in 4ms
```

(optional) compile scss & optimize the files for deployment or whatever reason, this code will minify the css and js files, set a hash on the files etc.

```
  npm run build
```

# Live sites URL.

The projects are hosted online for free on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It will last approximately for 3 months

#### Since I don't have the Figma Design files for many projects, the results aren't pixel-perfect.

# Goals

- Write clean and well-structured SCSS without many repetitions for better maintainability
- Use BEM methodology
- Use images with the correct dimensions & type to ensure optimal performance and avoid unnecessary scaling.
- Implement best practices for achieving a strong website performance, including techniques like image optimization, code minification, font preload, SVG Sprites etc.

- Evaluate and identify the best tools, plugins, and workflow setup to maximize efficiency and productivity.
  Tools, plugins & methodology I am currently using/testing:

1. [Parceljs](https://parceljs.org/)
2. [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
3. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
4. [postcss](https://postcss.org/)
5. [postcss-sort-media-queries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-sort-media-queries)
